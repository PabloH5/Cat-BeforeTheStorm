# Cat-Before the Storm

This game was created for the Brackeys Game Jam 2024.2 on Itch.io. You can playit [here :3](https://pablitoh5.itch.io/cat-before-the-storm)
 
## Game Inspiration

I came up with this game as soon as I saw my cat (Arthur), who, after spotting a bug, enters a state of madness trying to catch them. 

Here, adapting my cat to the theme, I replaced bugs with pigeons, and the storm comes after catching a few. The main idea of the game is to prevent Arthur from eating them by scaring them away with your paw, because if he eats 3, he explodes, haha. 

I hope you have as much fun as I did making it!!
